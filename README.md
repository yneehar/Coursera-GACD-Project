# Coursera-GACD-Project
Project for the Coursera course: Getting and Cleaning Data in R. The R script `Run_Analysis.R` does the following:

1. To download the data set from a URL if not currently existing.
2. Load the features to be extracted.
3. Read data sets with the required features.
4. Merge train and test data.
5. Tidy up column names.
6. A final tidy data set with mean values for variables for each `Subject` and `Activity_Label` pair.
